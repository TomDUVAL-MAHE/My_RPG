Make a rpg game in CSFML

Made with Quentin CAMILLERI, Lucas TESNIER and Thomas PRUDHOMME


Rule of our project:

"This project is one of the freest project of your first year. Create your own RPG.

Your main challenge for this game will be to create a complete product using everything that you and your
team know.

Your game must follow the following rules:

• The player needs to have characteristics which you can find in the status menu.

• The player can fight enemies, statistics will impact the fights results.

• There must be NPC in your game.

• You need to implement at least one quest.

• The player must have an inventory which can contain a limited set of items.

• The player can earn experience by winning fights and accomplishing specific actions.

• With enough experience, the player can level up, upgrading its statistics.



To give the users the feeling that you’re delivering a complete product you need to polish as much as possible
your game.

• Having a pleasant user interface.

• Create a coherent universe (visual assets, audio assets, scenario, . . .)

• Create a funny game where the player has at least one goal.

• Create a game with a beginning and an end."
